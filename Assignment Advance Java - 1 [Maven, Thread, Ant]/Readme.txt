This is the project created during the training session at Nagarro. Assignment-1 of Advance Java is what to be followed in this project.

POM.xml has all the dependencies used in the Maven project.

build.xml is the ANT Script of the project.

App.java is the main file behind the project.

flight.java is the helper file while is helping App.java to read and store csv files.

ThankYou
